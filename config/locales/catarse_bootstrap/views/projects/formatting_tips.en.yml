        If you paste the URL of an image or a video from Vimeo or YouTube, it will
        appear in the project's description. Try it!

      urls_html: >
        By pasting an URL, it will turn into a link. For example,
        http://juntos.com.vc turns into <a class="alt-link" href="http://juntos.com.vc">
        http://juntos.com.vc</a>.

      labeled_urls_html: >
        If you want to put text in the link, just use the following format:
        "text you want":http://your.url. For example, "Juntos":http://juntos.com.vc
        turns into <a class="alt-link" href="http://juntos.com.vc">Juntos</a>.

      bold_text_html: >
        You can use bold by adding two asterisks (**) before and after the text
        you want to format. For example, **my bold text** will appear as <b>my
        bold text</b>.

      italic_text_html: >
        You can use italics by adding an underscore (_) before and after the text
        you want to format. For example, _my text in italics_ will appear as <em>
        my text in italics</em>.
